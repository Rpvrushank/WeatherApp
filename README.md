## Design

* On app open, from android LocationManager, fetch the current location and call the openweather api, to fetch the current weather and display in the recyclerview.
* On search fragment, on any text changes, fetch the location based on the query.
* On tap on place, use the place to fetch lat and long, use the location to fetch the weather and show the same in recyclerview.
